
Why Do We Use Linux Over Windows in DevOps?

Linux is the most used operating system in servers, cloud, and 
DevOps environments.
✅ 1. Open Source (Free)
✅ 2. Better Performance
✅ 3. More Secure
✅ 4. Best for Automation & Scripting
✅ 5. Most Cloud & DevOps Tools Are Linux-Friendly
✅ 6. Stability (Runs Without Restart)
✅ 7. Full Control (Command Line Power)
✅ 8. Used Everywhere in Cloud

🐧 Basic Architecture of Linux Kernel
 
🧱 Main Components of Linux Kernel

Think of the kernel as the bridge between Hardware and Applications

User Applications

   System Calls

 Mgmt   Mgmt  System Drivers
        |
     Network

🔁 Simple Flow
Application → System Call → Kernel → Hardware
Hardware Response → Kernel → Application

🐚 What is a Shell?

👉 A Shell is a program that acts as a bridge between the user and
 the Linux operating system.

It allows users to:
Run commands
Execute programs
Control the system

💡 You type commands → Shell understands → Kernel executes them

Examples of Shells:
Bash (most common)
Sh
Ksh
Zsh

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

📜 What is Shell Scripting?

👉 Shell scripting means writing a file that contains multiple shell commands 
to be executed automatically.
Instead of typing commands one by one, you put them into a script.
A shell script is just a text file with .sh extension
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Shell Scripting is Important in DevOps?

Automates repetitive tasks
Saves time
Reduces manual errors
Used in deployments, backups, monitoring
