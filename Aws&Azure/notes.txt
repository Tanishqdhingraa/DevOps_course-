🚀 Importance of Automation in DevOps

👉 Automation means using scripts and tools to perform tasks automatically 
instead of doing them manually.
In DevOps, automation helps teams:
Deploy faster
Reduce human errors
Scale easily
Save time and cost
Keep environments consistent

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Without automation, engineers would have to manually create servers,
configure networks, install software — which is slow and error-prone.

Example: Automation in AWS (EC2)

Instead of going to AWS Console and clicking buttons:
👉 A developer can write a script
👉 The script makes a request to AWS EC2 API
👉 AWS checks if the request is valid
👉 If approved → A new EC2 instance is created automatically
So automation = talking directly to AWS through code

---------------------------------------------------------------
What Happens When Script Calls AWS API?
When your script sends a request to AWS:
Authentication → AWS checks Who are you?
(Access Key / IAM Role)
Authorization → AWS checks Are you allowed to do this?
(IAM Permissions)
Validation → AWS checks if the request format is correct
✅ If everything is correct → AWS creates the resource (like EC2)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a Script in DevOps?
👉 A script is a set of instructions written in code to automate tasks.

You can automate AWS using:

1️⃣ AWS CLI
Command line tool to interact with AWS
Example:
aws ec2 run-instances ...

2️⃣ AWS SDK / API
Use programming languages like Python, Java, Node.js to call AWS APIs

3️⃣ AWS CloudFormation (CFT)
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool
You write a template (YAML/JSON) to define infrastructure

4️⃣ AWS CDK
Write infrastructure using programming languages (Python, TS, Java) 
instead of YAML

5️⃣ Terraform (Open Source)
Most popular Infrastructure as Code tool
Works with AWS + Azure + GCP + many more
