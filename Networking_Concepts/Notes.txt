🌐 Networking Concepts for DevOps – Short Notes


✅ What is an IP Address?
👉 An IP address is a unique number given to a device on 
a network to identify it and communicate with other devices.
Example:192.168.1.10
--------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ What is IPv4?
👉 IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the most commonly used 
IP version.
Size: 32 bits
Format: 4 numbers separated by dots
Total addresses: ~4.3 billion
Example:172.31.40.167
--------------------------------------------------------------------


✅ What do the dots mean in IPv4?
Each dot separates the IP into 4 octets.
Example:192.168.1.5
Octet	Value
1st	    192
2nd	    168
3rd	    1
4th	    5
👉 Each octet is 8 bits
👉 Each value range: 0 – 255
--------------------------------------------------------------------


✅ What is a Subnet?
👉 A subnet is a small network inside a larger network.
Subnetting = dividing one big network into multiple smaller networks.


🎓 College Networking Example (Easy to Remember)
Without Subnetting ❌
One college
One big network
All students + staff + labs in same network

Problems:
Slow network
Security issues
Too much broadcast traffic


With Subnetting ✅
College network is divided like this:
Department	Subnet
Computer Science	192.168.1.0/24
Electronics	192.168.2.0/24
Mechanical	192.168.3.0/24
Administration	192.168.4.0/24

👉 Each department has its own subnet
👉 Traffic is controlled
👉 Security is improved
--------------------------------------------------------------------


✅ Advantages of Subnetting
Better network performance
Reduced network congestion
Improved security
Easy management
Efficient IP address usage

--------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Types of Subnets
🔹 Public Subnet
Accessible from the internet
Used for:
Load balancers
Web servers

🔹 Private Subnet
Not accessible from the internet
Used for:
Databases
Backend servers

👉 In AWS:
EC2 in public subnet → has public IP
EC2 in private subnet → no public IP

--------------------------------------------------------------------


✅ How CIDR Helps in Subnetting?
👉 CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) defines:
Network size
Number of IPs
Example:192.168.1.0/24


/24 → first 24 bits are network bits
Remaining 8 bits → host bits

Total IPs = 256
CIDR Examples (Important)
CIDR	Total IPs
/24	256
/25	128
/26	64
/27	32

👉 CIDR allows flexible subnetting
👉 Avoids IP wastage
👉 Very important in cloud networking
